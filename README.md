# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Nishant Bundela**. I like science and philosophy ;) With a mix of skills in ML/AI, Software Development, Mechatronics, and Product Management, I'm all about mixing and matching to find exciting solutions.

Currently, I specialize in building full-stack applications that use LLMs, advanced RAG, and agents to query and perform actions with massive amounts of unstructured and structured data (Research papers, Images, Audio, Video, Presentations, CSVs, SQL Databases, and more).

I like to call myself technology-agnostic, to me the purpose is what matters. Tools and technologies can be learned.
