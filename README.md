### Hi there 👋

I am Nishant Bundela, a Product Developer for disruptive technologies and someone who enjoys creating solutions to complex real-world problems. I like to bring out the best in people and I harness a diverse blend of expertise in Product Management, Software Engineering, Applied Artificial Intelligence, and Data Science. It isn't merely breadth that I seek, but the interconnectedness and profound understanding of every component in the chain of implementation — the key to sculpting exceptional products that truly make a difference.

I hold a firm conviction that Artificial Intelligence is poised to bring forth a paradigm shift of unparalleled magnitude. I not only want to be a catalyst in this transformation but also lead and advocate for this revolutionary wave. Currently, I am immersed in the research, documentation, and deployment of cutting-edge AI technologies, committed to pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

If my journey resonates with you or if you find my professional experience intriguing, I welcome you to connect. Let's engage in insightful conversations and explore the vast landscape of possibilities together :) 

👨🏻‍🎓 Master of Science in Engineering Management from Johns Hopkins University.
